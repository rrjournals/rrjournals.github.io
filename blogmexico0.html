			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Later in 2019, I still had a few extra weeks vacation that I had to use before year end. I also still had a bit of an itch for the outdoors after my trip to Costa Rica earlier that year. I wanted to see more nature, wildlife and spend some time by the beach. However, I wanted really good food too! As I mentioned, Costa Rican food was good but nothing spectacular. My favourite cuisines that I have had while traveling would be Indian, Vietnamese and Mexican. If I were to rank them, I’d say my starting five would be Indian, Mexican, Vietnamese, Thai and Cuban, with Costa Rican being my 6th man off the bench.</font></p>
			<ol><font face="Book Antiqua">
		 	<li>Indian (probably a bit of a home bias)</li>
			<li>Mexican (I like spicy as you may be able to tell)</li>
			<li>Vietnamese</li>
			<li>Thai</li>
			<li>Cuban (granted, this was just a couple meals outside of the resort – I don’t know if that’s enough of a sample size)</li>
			<li>Costa Rican</li>
			<li>Hong Kong (not sure if that's a cuisine or if it falls under Chinese?)</li>
			</font></ol>  

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I am also biased towards places requiring shorter flights and so Mexico came up again as a potential destination. I had been to Mexico City the year before, so I had a sense of what to expect. Mexico is a massive country and so, through a few google searches, I found that the south had a lot to explore. I also had two weeks which was a good amount of time. I considered going to Guadalajara and Sayulite (more in the north) but realized it would just be too rushed to hit all these spots in two weeks.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I decided to fly to Oaxaca City and fly out of Cancun. Once I was in Oaxaca, I ended up taking a bus to San Cristobal, Chiapas from Oaxaca City and then another bus to Palenque, Chiapas. From there, I flew to Cancun but headed straight to Tulum to avoid the boatloads of tourists/resorts and then took a bus and ferry to Holbox as my final stop. This gave me a good mix of city (i.e., Oaxaca), nature (i.e, San Cristobal’s surrounding area), nightlife (i.e., Tulum) and beach (i.e., Holbox).</p>
			
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The flights were reasonable. I paid ~$430 to Oaxaca and then $230 from Cancun back to Toronto. The flight to Oaxaca went through Mexico City but the flight from Cancun was direct. Its also worth noting for anyone thinking about Mexico that Puerto Vallarta also has direct flights from Toronto. Unfortunately, within the country, its hard to get around by plane though as most flights route you through Mexico City which means a layover and that you are not necessarily taking the most efficient route.</p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I was telling my Dad about the trip who had to use some vacation and he quickly booked flights as well, but he intended to only come for a week.</p>
