			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Sunday was my last full day in New Orleans as I worked remotely on Monday and then flew back on Tuesday morning. Given New Orleans’ rich music history, I decided to book a music tour online. It was $30 and a guide met me at Louis Armstrong Park. The guy could talk! We spent about two hours together and he had so much to share that we barely left the park. Nonetheless, it was still super interesting, and I learned a ton.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The rest of the day, I roamed around. I went to a local mall… with air conditioning (such a blessing). I got some beignets there! Super good. It’s basically fried dough with powdered sugar. One thing I learned about New Orleans is that you should diet before you go there because you are going to gain weight. The food is tasty but always unhealthy – I don’t think I saw one salad in the entire city. I may have told a friend of mine that I felt like a super model just walking down the street as there definitely is an obesity issue in New Orleans.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I kept roaming the mall and found a super cool store that sold custom jerseys with unique designs. I really considered buying some Raptors jerseys but did not. The designers add their own touch that represents the city or the team’s history to the regular jersey. The craziest thing happened though as I was sending photos to my basketball friends in a group chat… some guy ran out of the store, stealing a few jerseys! It was actually insane. I had never witnessed a robbery before. The guy bolted out the door and out of the mall before the staff could catch up – they also didn’t try too hard. Security came but I figure that was my cue to leave.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I went back to the French Quarter and had a nice meal before calling it an early night. On the Monday, I worked remotely and got some Popeyes for lunch (had to try it in Louisiana). My last meal was at Armantine’s and had a Crawfish Etouffe.</font></p>
