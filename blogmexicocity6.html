			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I checked out a few more museums this day but this day was really about getting tickets to a soccer game. I realized that I only had two more days left in Mexico and it randomly came to me that I should see a soccer game! I wasn't sure when I'd be back again... I found out online that you can buy these at Ticketmaster locations found across the city. I found one close to a museum I was visiting that Thursday and decided to stop by. It took me 45 minutes to find it as it was tucked away in the mall behind a restaurant. In broken Spanish, I tried to ask for tickets for that evening's semi-final match between Club Americas and Pumas. There were tickets for 250 pesos ($17 CAD) so I was stoked and ready to purchase them... but as I was about to purchase them, I noticed that this was for the second leg three days later. I needed tickets for that night, but they were sold out... I was devastated. It felt like my trip would not be the same without seeing this soccer game, so I was determined. I quickly started googling how to get tickets and realized I could scalp them outside the stadium. I talked to the locals staying at my hostel and they said you may get ripped off and pay 1000 pesos, but you can get tickets.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I decided I would try it! It would be a good story regardless: either I get tickets and have a great time, or I get ripped off and lose $60...</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I took a bus down towards the Estadio Olímpico Universitario. It was crowded and sweaty but I somehow found a seat. I got there and followed the crowds when I got off the bus. Soon, I'd see counterfeit jerseys being sold and guys screaming “boleto”, I was close! I kept walking and knew not to trust the guys selling tickets who had stacks of them. The people at my hostel recommended finding a family/couple with 1-2 tickets to sell because you know those would be official.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I soon walked by a couple and in broken Spanish bought a ticket! I bargained down to 700 pesos from 1000 pesos, while conversing using google translate. I was a bit nervous but decided to pull the trigger. I asked them "Oficial? No problema?" and he responded "Si, si!" The guy gave me his card in case there was a problem and it said he worked for Ticketmaster? They then walked me to the front of the line and got the ushers to let me in before the rest of the crowd... I was thankful but confused too. I was relieved to just be in the stadium.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Anyway, this ended up being one of the coolest experiences of my life! The seats were concrete benches, and nobody sat down. The beer was really foamy but I couldn't care less. They were chanting the entire time and I just cheered for the team that was supported by the people in my area.</font></p>
