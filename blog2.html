			<h2><FONT FACE="Georgia">Day Numero Uno (to Day 3)</font></h2>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">At 4:30 a.m., I finally stepped out into the Mumbai air after almost 24 hours of traveling. I immediately saw my uncle waving out to me with a bottle of water...something I welcomed as the temperature was 30&degC+. On the way to his car, we stopped to talk to someone he knew from a while back. Something I learned here in India is that despite there being over 1 Billion people, somehow, (almost) everybody knows (almost) everyone. Once we arrived at his car, I instinctively reached for the right side door before he jokingly asked me "Do you want to drive?" In India, they drive on the left side of the road...awkward.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua"> And even if I did want to drive... I probably wouldn't last a traffic signal. Why? Because traffic signals exist but mean nothing... driving is absolutely insane in Mumbai. They could have a ride at Wonderland called "Mumbai Driving". But I digress.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The following day, after being delayed twice, my flight from Mumbai to Hubli finally took off. I flew by an airline called SpiceJet... how fitting for an airline in India? Upon landing at Hubli's airport, I met AquaSafi's Relationship Manager who took me to my hostel, located on the B.V. Bhoomaraddi College of Engineering and Technology (BVB College) campus. He also gave me a company SIM card... I was in business (actually, I am in business... that's what I'm studying). At the hostel, I met the other intern who had arrived a month earlier, and she gave me the scoop on the place.</font></p>
	
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">My room is intended for two people so it is quite large. This would become home for the next two months. I had two single beds, but if there is anything I learned from Rez Life... 1 single bed + 1 single bed = a double bed. Check it out:</font></p>

			<h2><FONT FACE="Georgia">About Hubli</font></h2>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Hubli, originally known as Hubbali, means "Flowering creeper" in the regional language Kannada. It is the second largest city in the state of Karnataka and is considered an educational hub (yeah, there are schools and colleges everywhere). By Indian standards, Hubli is a small city, even though it is home to 1.35 million people!</font></p>

			<h2><FONT FACE="Georgia">Other interesting facts about India</font></h2>	
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Hindi and English are the two most widely spoken languages in India. However, each region also has its own language. Therefore, most people are trilingual.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">India is also home to the largest population of English speaking people on the planet. Mainly because there are over 1 Billion people, and many learn English.</font></p>
