			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">This was now Sunday! The weather was super nice, and we slept in quite a bit. We ended up doing a Dim Sum breakfast/lunch in our Airbnb. Two of our friends went to TnT (across the street) and picked several items! It was super reasonable and hit the spot perfectly on a Sunday morning.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We eventually walked over to Granville Island – it was about 45 minutes but felt like longer as we stopped for coffee and to take photos as the views were awesome. Granville Island has a market and a bunch of little shops. We eventually got there, and I got a sausage roll from the market and chocolate. There was live music, and we were all dead at this point, so we spent time together without talking much for a bit LOL.</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">We got a beer at the Vancouver Fish Company afterwards and then headed home to change for dinner. This would be where I lost my sunglasses...</font></p>

		<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Side note: When I was on the work trip in Calgary, I left my sunglasses at a Bistro there. I did not realize until I got back to Toronto later in the week. Anyway, I eventually called that Bistro where we had breakfast and they still had them! So, my friend from Calgary got them before we went to Vancouver. These were prescription sunglasses, so I was so relieved to get them back.</font></p>

		<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I kept thinking I had left them at the brewery, so I called them but no dice. My hunch was that they fell out of my pocket while sitting on the bench outside waiting for our uber. My friend and I were doing weird stretches so that seemed like the most plausible situation. In a final effort, I tried our Uber driver... and he had them! So, the next day, he returned them. #blessed2.0. I am proud to say that I am writing this about 8 months after the trip after visiting New Orleans and Peru and I have not lost my sunglasses since (although I did misplace them at work briefly in the summer).</font></p>

		<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Anyway, Tasty’s was so good! The Indian food was amazing.</font></p>
