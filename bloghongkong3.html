			<h2><FONT FACE="Garamond">The Race Track</font></h2>
			<p>Like I mentioned in a previous post, it was super easy to make friends at the hostel and so my first night I ended up going to the race track! I thought I was going to sleep right away since I barely slept on my flight but I met another traveller in the elevator up to my room and she and some other backpackers were going to the race track.</p>
			
			<p>The atmosphere at the race track was unreal and so for roughly $1.50 CAD, it was worth it! I felt as though there were three groups of people that attended these races: the tourists/backpackers who just want to see horses race and drink beer, the casual fans who are from Hong Kong, and the avid, avid (did I mention avid?) fans!</p>

		    <div class = "col-sm-10 fontwhite">
		    <p>1)	The tourists/backpackers would get up really close to the race track and place an uneducated bet hoping the payoff would be enough to cover their night out.</p>
			<p>2)	The casual fans were the local people who would come to enjoy a night out. They would sit in the stands, wander down to the race track to grab a beer and place a bet or two.</p>
			<p>3)	The avid, avid fans sat up in the stands, usually in the membersâ€™ only area. They had descriptions of all the horses and all the odds and placed, what I assumed would be, educated bets. These people were INTO it!</p>

			<div class="container fontwhite">
			<p>Anyway, at the race track we met some other travellers and expats working in Hong Kong. We had a few beers and I was eventually convinced to place a bet. I took the safe route (because I would soon be working for a company that believes in passive investments and Exchange Traded Funds) and placed a bet on the favourite but lost. Being a bust, I named this horse Anthony Bennett.</p>

			<div class="container fontwhite">
			<p>My plan was to head back to the hostel since the lack of sleep was starting to hit me, but a few of the people I met were going to a bar in Wan Chai. I had to drop some stuff off at the hostel, but they convinced me to go and come back since it was close to where I was staying. I made it back, but soon realized the party was in the streets! Since you can buy beer at 7/11 and drink openly outside the bar, it ended up being a better (and cheaper) atmosphere outside. You could get a beer for $2 CAD at 7/11 or pay close to $12 CAD inside. Woah!</p>
			<p>Note: Hong Kong can be pretty sketchy as I heard some stories from another Canadian who had lived there for a year. Also, when I asked a guy for directions in Wan Chai while trying to meet up with my new friends, he asked me if I wanted to buy cocaine, heroine or weed... what a first impression (this was like at 9 pm on a well-lit corner, not like 3 am in an alley)!</p>
