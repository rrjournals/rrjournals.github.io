      <p><font face="Book Antiqua">So kids... (I have been watching the show "How I met your Mother" quite a bit recently and that just felt like the appropriate way to start a story). Anyway... this was a family vacation we went on during the 2017 holidays. I had promised in <a href="blogcuba.html" style="color:#8db9df"><strong>my previous blog post</strong></a> that I would never go on a "resort" vacation again. However, my parents had never been on a 'do nothing, lie on the beach, drink beer all day' type of vacation before and so they wanted to give it a go. My mom has also been pushing us to do more family vacations before my sister and I became real adults. Our previous family vacations had typically been trips to India to visit relatives or vacations where we went around sight-seeing. Most of these sight-seeing vacations had been to the east and west coasts of Canada or to somewhere in the United States. So, this was a new family experience and even though I had previously promised never to go to a resort again, I was excited!</font></p>
      
      <p><font face="Book Antiqua"><strong>TL, DW (Too Long, Didn't Write)</strong>: The trip to Punta Cana was a lot of fun overall but after 4-5 days, I was pretty bored. I played beach soccer, tried to practice my spanish, drank lots of beer and ate lots of food while spending time in the water. Other than that, not too much to report on. The restaurants were hit or miss but the entertainment was actually quite good (our resort in Cuba didn't have much entertainment or any at all for that matter). Overall, it felt weird being at a beach party on Christmas Eve and not in church or freezing my butt off. Christmas didn't have the same charm this year. However, the one piece of memory capturing I did do was with my sportscam. The waves were some of the biggest I had ever seen and so I got a few great videos and thought I'd share! These waves were about 8 feet high on some occasions and would carry you about 20 feet back to shore if you weren't ready (I did lose my favourite pair of sunglasses in the waves). See some awesome videos below :)</font></p>
