			<h2><FONT FACE="Georgia">Getting Accepted</font></h2>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">In mid-March I received an offer from Western University to take part in the <a href="blog8.html" style="color:#8db9df"><strong>Ontario Global Edge Program</strong></a>. I was paired up with a company called <a href="blog8.html" style="color:#8db9df"><strong>AquaSafi</strong></a> and would be working as a "Business Proposal Intern." Woo! My first real business job, I was ecstatic! I had chosen not to apply to go on exchange for my final year of study, and so this would be my going abroad experience.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">Although setting up the call was not without its fair share of difficulties due to time differences, a few days after receiving my offer, I skyped one of my employers (the Director of Communications). It was 7:30 p.m. in Hubli, India, and 10 a.m. in London, Canada, and we talked for about 10-15 minutes. I found out my role was a lot more undefined than I had expected. In the job description, it stated I would be working to secure funding for the company through grants and by partnering with other organizations. However, it seemed like I would be working on ad hoc projects. #exciting</font></p>

			<h2><FONT FACE="Georgia">Visa, flights and what else do you need to go to India?</font></h2>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">The next steps after that have been to:
			<li>Get my employment visa, which involves being very patient with the Indian Consulate </li>
			<li>Get my travel shots and medication - Despite multiple vaccinations and a bunch of pills, you're still supposed to get sick</li>
			<li>Book my flights - I will be flying via Abu Dhabi (where I will visit with a Sheikh) to Mumbai. From Mumbai, I will take another flight to Hubli. Since my uncle lives in Mumbai, I will be spending a day with him, eating some mangoes and resting up before going to Hubli.</li>
			<li>And finally, start packing.</li>
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua"> 
			Date and time of departure: June 5 at 10:45 p.m. I'll probably be too excited to sleep.
