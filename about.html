			<h2><FONT FACE="Baskerville Old Face">about me</font></h2>
			<div class="col-lg-12 toppadding"><p>I am currently a Pre-Business Lecturer at the Ivey Business School in London, Canada, where I teach the Pre-Ivey course Business 2257 (Accounting and Business Analysis). My interests include sports, entrepreneurship, finance, pok&eacutemon and the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Being from Toronto, I am an avid supporter of the Toronto Raptors and Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
			<p>I have also recently taken an interest in computer programming, and have used these skills to design this website.</p>

			<h4><strong><FONT FACE="Baskerville Old Face">Why did I start this blog?</font></strong></h4>
		</div>
		<div class="container fontwhite">
			<div class="col-lg-12"><p>After my first year at the Ivey Business School, where I pursued a degree in Honours Business Administration, I received an internship with start-up in India called AquaSafi. I was thrilled to be going to India, and the work the company was doing was very interesting! They were helping bring clean water to rural villages in India using a patented water purification process. They were a for-profit branch of H20 for Humanity, and their patented technology allowed them to purify water at a very low cost.</p>
			<p> After telling my family and friends about this internship, they suggested I start a blog so they could follow my travels. Having recently learned some basic coding, I thought I'd design my own blog! And so I did.</p>
			<p> Traveling in India was an awesome experience, and I found blogging to be quite enjoyable. Even if no one reads your blog, its a great way to preserve your memories, and so I decided to continue the blog upon returning home.</p>
