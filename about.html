				<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I am currently working as an Manager on the Client Experience Team at <a href=https://www.wealthsimple.com/en-ca/><strong style="color:#8db9df">Wealthsimple</strong></a>! We are super fast growing online investment service in Canada and now manage over five billion in assets for over 200,000 people. I started working here in June 2017 after my travels through Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand and Cuba!</font></p>
				<p><font face="Book Antiqua"> Prior to that, I spent two years as a Pre-Business Lecturer at the Ivey Business School in London, Canada, teaching the Pre-Ivey course Business 2257 (Accounting and Business Analysis). My interests include sports, entrepreneurship, finance, pok&eacutemon and the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Being from Toronto, I am an avid supporter of the Toronto Raptors and Toronto Maple Leafs. I also spend way too much time playing Fantasy Sports.</font></p>
				<p><font face="Book Antiqua"> I have also recently taken an interest in coding and whatever building this website is called, and have used these skills to design this blog!</font></p></div>

			<h4><FONT FACE="Georgia">Why did I start this blog?</font></h4>
		</div>
		<div class="container fontwhite">
			<div class="col-sm-12" style="margin-top:10px;"><p><font face="Book Antiqua"> After my first year at the Ivey Business School, where I pursued a degree in Honours Business Administration, I received an internship with social enterprise in India called <a href=http://www.aquasafi.com/><strong style="color:#8db9df">AquaSafi</strong></a>. I was thrilled to be going to India, and the work the company was doing was very interesting! They were helping bring clean water to rural villages in India using a patented water purification process. They were a for-profit branch of H2O for Humanity, and their patented technology allowed them to purify water at a very low cost. You can find a case I wrote on them while teaching at the Ivey Business School <a href=https://www.iveycases.com/ProductView.aspx?id=85910 style="color:#8db9df"><strong>here</strong></a>!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua"> Anyway, after telling my family and friends about this internship, they suggested I start a blog so they could follow my travels. Having recently learned some basic coding, I thought I'd design my own blog! And so I did.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Book Antiqua"> Traveling in India was an awesome experience, and I found blogging to be quite enjoyable. Even if no one reads your blog, its a great way to preserve your memories, and so I decided to continue the blog upon returning home. If you are reading this... woohoo! I hope you enjoy :)</font></p>
