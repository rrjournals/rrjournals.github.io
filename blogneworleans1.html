			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">On Friday, I was looking for something to do and had heard some people at the conference talking about going to a “Saints” game. The Saints are New Orleans’ football team and so I decided to check for tickets online. They were just $7 for the upper bowl tickets! I am not a big football fan but for $7, I figured it was worth it. Granted, it was a pre-season game, but I had never been to a football game, and knew it would make for a great story! I would also get to see an NFL stadium...</font></p>


			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">I had some trouble buying the tickets, so I didn’t have time to eat before the game. I figured I’d grab some street meat or something at the game. There weren’t too many street vendors and the food at the stadium wasn’t that appetizing or was too expensive for something that was not authentic to New Orleans. I decided to save the calories for a more legitimate New Orleans meal after the game. Anyway, the stadium was massive! I knew football stadiums in America were huge and just from the outside, the Little Caesars Superdome dwarfs the Smoothie King Centre (where the New Orleans Pelicans play). The Superdome holds close to 80,000 people while the Smoothie King Centre holds only 17,000...</font></p>

			<p><font face="Book Antiqua">After the second quarter, I started to get bored. I was on my own and I am not a big football fan… so I left. I headed towards Bourbon Street to get some food and found myself at Musical Legends Park where I got some gumbo and caught some live music. I hung out there for the rest of the night!</font></p>
