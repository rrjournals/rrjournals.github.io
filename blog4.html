			<h2><FONT FACE="Baskerville Old Face">BVB Grounds</font></h2>
			<p>These grounds are my second home. I spend most of my mornings and evenings here, and it's where I have met the most people. The grounds are located right behind my hostel, so from 6:30 am to 9 am every day I am there.  In the mornings I usually play basketball with guys from the college team #futureSimBhullars and former coaches. I always remind them that a Canadian invented the sport. The group consists of about 8-10 guys, and they have been playing there for about 15 years! Later in the day, around 5:30 pm, I usually return to play football (real football). I still wear my Brazil jersey even after the World Cup disaster, so the people who do not speak English think I am crazy.</p>

			<p>Between the hours of 5:30 am and 9 am, and 5 pm and 7 pm you can always find something to play, whether it is basketball, football or cricket. I have played cricket a few times, but we got kicked off the field by an actual practicing team both times...The rest of the day, the grounds are deserted as it is simply too hot to be outside.</p>

			<h2><FONT FACE="Baskerville Old Face">Cricket</font></h2>
			<p>People in India are crazy about cricket... For example, Maria Sharapova recently lost all of her Indian tennis fans after <a href="http://www.news.com.au/sport/tennis/maria-sharapova-infuriates-indian-cricket-fans-by-admitting-she-has-no-idea-who-sachin-tendulkar-is/story-fndkzym4-1226977725518" style="color:#8db9df"><strong>she said that she did not know who Sachin Tendulkar was</strong></a>. He is one of India's greatest and most famous cricket players, and is adored by the entire country. They call him the "God of Cricket". Since India itself has a population of 1 Billion people... he may well be the most popular athlete on the planet.</p>

			<p>To further my point about the popularity of cricket... even though field hockey is the national sport, wherever there is an empty space, you will find a cricket match being played. People bring a bat and a ball, use stones or a tree for wickets, and start a match. I remember passing through a nearby town once and seeing three different fields, and on each of the fields, a cricket match was being played.</p>
